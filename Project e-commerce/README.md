### Info:
E-commerce analysis. Analysis of customer behavior, delivery performance and online shopping trends.

### Data:
Data set which contains all the transactions for a registered non-store online retail. The dataset contains information about users, order statuses, and order contents.

### Goal:
Provide e-commerce analysis and analysis of customer behavior, delivery performance and online shopping trends.

### Steps to achieve the goal:
- Pre-analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Sales analysis
- Cohort analysis
- RFM analysis for Customer Segmentation

### Tasks:
- Determine how many customers made a purchase only once.
- Determine how many orders per month on average are not delivered for various reasons (detail the reasons)?
- Determine on which day of the week the product is most often purchased for each product.
- Determine how many purchases each customer has on average per week (by month)?
- Cohort analysis of users.
- RFM analysis for customer segmentation.

### Results:
- Most of the users made only 1 purchase.
- On average, 124 orders are not delivered per month for various reasons. Most orders that have not been delivered to the user have the following statuses:
  - shipped
  - canceled
  - unavailable
  - invoice
  - processing
- Most often goods are purchased on Monday, and least often on weekends.
- Cohort analysis showed that in the second month, there is a sharp drop in retention, almost no one makes any purchases in the second month (which is not surprising, since most users did not make more than one purchase).
- RFM-analysis showed that TOP 3 segments are:
  - Dormant one-time / rare users: there are many of them, and they have brought a lot of income, there is still a chance that they will make a purchase, they need to be stirred up and motivated, you can send them a newsletter with promotions.
  - Beginners. We need to maintain their interest. You can send a newsletter describing the benefits of the service and answers to frequently asked questions.
  - One-time users are most likely users who have already left, it is not worth wasting resources on them.
