### Info:
The team has developed a new algorithm for finding the most suitable profiles. An AB test was conducted to verify the algorithm's operation. All users were divided into two groups: with an old algorithm application for searching profiles and with a new one.

### Goal:
Analytical conclusion whether to include a new algorithm for searching profiles for all users.

### Tasks:
Select service quality metrics and statistically compare them in two groups.  
Assess whether the new algorithm has improved the quality of service.
