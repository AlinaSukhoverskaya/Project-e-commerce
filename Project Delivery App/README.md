- Exploratory Data Analysis
- A/B Testing Result Analysis
- Selecting metrics
- Hypothesis testing
- Calculating statistical significance
- Student's t-test, Welch's t-test, Chi-squared test

### Info:
The team has introduced a smart product recommendation system into the application. It is expected that such a system will help users work more efficiently with the application and better find the necessary products. An AB test was conducted to test the effectiveness of the recommendation system. First group included users with a new recommendation system, second group included users with an old version of the application, which does not recommend products.

### Data:  
- user order history, information about which orders were created and canceled by users
- detailed information about the contents of the order, list of products ids for each order
- detailed information about products: names and prices

### Goal:
Analytical conclusion whether to include a new recommendation system for all users.

### Tasks:
Select service quality metrics and statistically compare them in two groups.
